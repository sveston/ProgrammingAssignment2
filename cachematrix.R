## Inverse of matrix is a time consuming process and hence it will be efficient if the inverse can be
## store in the cache for retreiver instead of recalculating all over again.
## cachematrix basically creates a storage in the cache for this special matrix

## makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to
# - set the value of the matrix
# - get the value of the matrix
# - set the value of the inverse
# - get the value of the inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(inv) i <<- inv
  getinv <- function() i
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)
}


## cacheSolve calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and 
## sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinv function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  i <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinv(i)
  i
}
